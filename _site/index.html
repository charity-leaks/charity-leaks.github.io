					<h2>Do you have a minute to help your neighbor?</h2>
					
					<p>In 2016, 8 out of 10 homes in Switzerland (from ZEWO) have donated money to charities in diverse domains such as social help, education, or medical help for a total of 1,7 billions of Swiss Francs.</p>

					<p>The primaries of a charitable organization are <i>philanthropy</i> and <i>social well-being</i>. So when you donate money to a charity, you expect that your donations will profit to the ones that are in need. The Panama Papers have shown that the reality could be darker. Indeed, some well-known charitative organization have been named in the recent fraud leak (Panamas and Paradise Papers, Offshore and Bahamas Leaks) as the <i> International Red Cross</i> or <i>WWF</i>.</p>

					<p>This raise serious questions about how money is treated among charities and could create serious issues for them. One of the main keys to success for charities are their reputation and the trust we have in them. To maintain this trust, these organizations must be transparent and prove the truthfulness of their actions.</p>

					<p>A scandal taking part in fraud leaks can lead to serious impact on the reputation of these charities and on the donations they will receive. Who would give money to rich people, fructuating for the nes that have already too much? But the situation is much more complicated! Indeed, it has come out that many shell companies in the Panama Papers were stealing the identity of charities. This of course can put the reputations of perfectly honest charities at risk.</p>

					<p>Thus, we decided to investigate which charity named in theses leaks were worthy or not of our trust.</p>

					<p>To hunt down dishonest charities we used the database of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) containing information about major financial data leaks that occurred in the last five years. Beforehand, it would be interesting to know how theses information got public. We chose to detail here the biggest and most leak: <i>the Panamas Papers</i>.</p>

					<h2>Where it all begins.</h2>
					<p><i>"Interested in data ? <…> There are a couple of conditions. My life is in danger. We will only chat over encrypted files. No meeting, ever."</i></p>

					<p>If you believe that this quote comes from a spy story, you are wrong. It is by this words that started the biggest data leaks in History, which led to demission of a prime minister and more. These words are from an anonymous source, calling himself John Doe, to Bastian Obermayer, an investigative Journalist working the Munich-based newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.</p>

					<p>This resulted in more than 11.5 million leaked document and 2.5 teraoctets of data that detail financial and attorney-client for more than 214'000 offshores entities from 1970 to 2016 in more than 150 countries.</p>

					<p>In his text called “The revolution will be digitized”, the anonymous whistleblower explains that he "understood enough about their contents to realise the scale of the injustices they described." and wanted to shed light upon theses crimes and make them public.</p>

					<p>But from where does the data come from? The information leaked from <i>Mossack Fonseca</i>, a Panamanian law firm and the world’s fourth larger provider of offshore financial services.</p>

					<p>After the exchange with the anonymous informator, the German journal sought help to the ICJC. A massive operation begun. After one year of investigation the results are finally published.</p>

					<p>Among them : name of then-current national leader, several former heads of state and prime ministers, actors, famous football players, and… Charities.</p>
