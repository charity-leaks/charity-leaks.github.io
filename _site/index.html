					<h2>Do you have a minute to help your neighbor?</h2>
					
					<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.zewo.ch/fr/Images/Statistiken/Infografik-F-2500px.png" target="_blank">8 out of 10 homes in Switzerland have donated money to charities </a> in diverse domains such as social help, education, or medical help for a total of 1.7 billions of Swiss Francs.</p>

					<p>The primary roles of a charitable organization are <i>philanthropy</i> and <i>social well-being</i>. When you donate money to a charity, you expect that your money will help those in need. The Panama Papers have shown that the reality could be darker. Indeed, some well-known caritative organization have been named in recent fraud leaks (Panamas and Paradise Papers, Offshore and Bahamas Leaks), such as the <i> International Red Cross</i> or <i>The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)</i>.</p>

					<p>This raises serious questions about how charities handle money and could create serious issues for them. Indeed, one of the main keys to success for charities is their reputation and the trust we have in them. To maintain this trust, these organizations must appear transparent and prove the truthfulness of their actions.</p>

					<p>Being caught with accounts in known tax havens can have a serious impact on the reputation of a charity and on the donations they will receive. After all, who would give money to an organisation knowing that it might well end up in some rich executive's offshore account? But the situation is much more complicated! Indeed, it has come out that many shell companies in the Panama Papers were stealing the identity of charities. This of course can put the reputations of perfectly honest charities at risk.</p>

					<p>Thus, we decided to investigate which charity named in theses leaks were worthy or not of our trust.</p>

					<p>To hunt down dishonest charities we used the database of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/" target="_blank">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a>, which contains information about major financial data leaks that occurred in the last five years. Let us tell you some more about how the most famous of these leaks: <i>the Panamas Papers</i>.</p>

					<h2>Where it all begins.</h2>
					<p><i>"Interested in data ? [...] There are a couple of conditions. My life is in danger. We will only chat over encrypted files. No meeting, ever."</i></p>

					<p>If you believe that this quote comes from a spy story, you are wrong. These are the words that started the biggest data leaks in History, leading to resignations, imprisonments and more. They come from an anonymous source, calling themselves John Doe, to Bastian Obermayer, an investigative journalist working for the Munich-based newspaper <a href="https://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56ff9a28a1bb8d3c3495ae13/" target="_blank">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a>.</p>

					<p>This resulted in more than 11.5 million leaked documents and 2.5 terabytes of data detailing the financial information of more than 214'000 offshores entities from 1970 to 2016 in more than 150 countries.</p>

					<p>In their text, titled “The revolution will be digitized”, the anonymous whistleblower explained about the leaks that he "<i>understood enough about their contents to realise the scale of the injustices they described</i>" and wanted to shed light upon the crimes they described.</p>

					<p>Where does the data come from? The information leaked from <i>Mossack Fonseca</i>, a Panamanian law firm and the world’s fourth larger provider of offshore financial services.</p>

					<p>After the exchange with the anonymous informer, the German newspaper sought help from the ICJC, and after a year of investigation into the leaked data, the results were finally published.</p>

					<p>Among the leaked names: one current head of state, several former heads of state and prime ministers, actors, famous football players, and… some of the world's most well-known charities.</p>

					<h2>One Dataset to rule them all.</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/about"  target="_blank">databases</a> released by ICJC contain information on:</p>
					
					<ul style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:2em">
					<li><b>The Offshore Leaks</b>: 130 000 offshore accounts disclosed in a report (2013)</li>
					<li><b>The Panamas Papers</b>: 214 000 offshore accounts from <i>Mossack Fonseca</i>, as presented above (2016)</li>
					<li><b>The Bahamas Leaks</b>: 1.3 million internal files from the company register of the Bahamas (2016)</li>
					<li><b>The Paradise Papers</b>: 13.4 millions electronic documents relating to offshore investments (2017)</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>This database is powered by <i>Neo4j</i>, a graph database that structures data in nodes and relationships. The <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database"  target="_blank">data</a> was downloaded as several CSV files, one for each actor and one for the link between them. The different nodes represent:</p>
					
					<ul style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:2em">
					<li><b>The offshore entity</b>: a company created in a low-tax jurisdiction that often attracts non-resident client through preferential tax treatment</li>
					<li><b>The officer</b>: a person or company who play a role in an offshore entity</li>
					<li><b>The intermediary</b>: a go-between for someone seeking an offshore corporation and an offshore service provider (usually a law firm)</li>
					<li><b>The address</b>: contact postal address as it appears in the original database</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In total, this database contains information about more than 785 000 offshore entities and links to people and companies in more than 200 countries. Note that these data come from leaked records and not a standardized corporate registry, so there may be duplicates (as similar appearances were not merged).</p>

					<p>No cleaning or standardization were necessary (<a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/faq#transformations" target="_blank">see ICIJ site for more details</a>).</p>

					<p>Before investigating among the charities, we can explore the dataset and the offshore companies to have a more general view of the situation. We were particularly interested in the Panamas Papers dataset. How were distributed the offshore companies around the world? How many countries sheltered these 200 000 companies?</p>

					<p>We were not surprised to see that majority of our entities were localized in a small number of countries. Indeed, half of the countries quoted in the dataset contain only a few offshore companies.</p>
					
					<img src="../img/bar.png" atl="Bar plot">
					
					<p style="margin-top:2em">Note the presence of the United Kingdom in the top 10; the UK is strongly appreciated by entrepreneurs and companies for his status of UK non-domicilied that enable to avoid taxes on foreign income.</p>

					<p>In conclusion, there was no particular surprise with this top 20 since every members are well-known tax heavens leading to a non-uniform geographic distribution:</p>

					</div>

					<p style="margin-top:2em"> But let's now take a closer look on our charities! We need first to find these charities in the database. Since no detail was given in the dataset about the different companies' functions, we need external data to help our investigation.</p>
					
					<p>We chose to use <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2016/12/14/the-largest-u-s-charities-for-2016/#5ca92a8d4abb" target="_blank">Forbes Magazine's list of the top 100 richest US charities</a>, the list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_non-governmental_organization" target="_blank">main non-governmental organizations</a> and the list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_charitable_foundations" target="_blank">main charitable foundations</a> on Wikipedia. We scraped these websites in order to form a new dataset of well-known charities. By merging together these results we obtained detailed information on more than 300 charities that we could use to investigate the ICIJ database. Details about charities include the name of the charities, the name of its main leaders, the headquarters address and the location of major offices. Note that the available data varies from charities to charities, resulting in a sometime sparse dataset.</p>

					<p>We decided to isolate potential charities in the Panama Papers by their name. We considered an offshore company to be a charity when its name was closely related to one of the scraped charitable foundation name. This was achieved by text mining, where an algorithm matched them based on a percentage of common significative words. Using this method, we reduced the dataset from hundreds of thousands of entities to a few hundred names.</p>

					<p>Considering the reasonnable number of matches and since Human possesses an expertise in natural language processing superior to any training tool, we inspected and corrected the potential matches manually.</p>

					<p>Among the matches, we found <i>Amnesty International</i>, the <i>International Red Cross</i>, and many other of the world's biggest aid agencies.</p>

					<h2>Fishing for rich vilains</h2>
					<p>How can we find out if an entity is an actual charity, and not some other shell corporation with a stolen name? </p>
					<h4>Checking the directory...</h4>
					<p>After investigating several methods, we finally chose to check the addresses of the matches we had. By definition, a shell company is a corporation that exists only on paper and has no office and no employees, but may have a bank account, and also needs a mailbox address. It could therefore be assumed that if a real charity’s headquarters match the mail address of a shell with the same name, these are indeed one and the same company.</p>
					
					<p>In the database provided by ICIJ, the majority of the offshore entities have an address registered as a specific node (<a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80135846" target="_blank">see example here</a>). 
					We decided to inspect these addresses for our matches and to compare them with the headquarters addresses of the corresponding charities that were found during the web scraping. If the addresses match, there is a high probability that the offshore accounts do indeed belong to the real charity.<p>
					
					<p>After extracting every nodes with a registered address corresponding to a match we obtained a list of 27 offshore entities. Among them, we discarded every match whose 
					charity headquarter location was not available in our data. We also removed the entities with an address registered in a Tax Heaven (Barbados, Aruba, Caraïb Islands) 
					when their corresponding charities were located in a different country.</p>
					
					<p>We obtained 11 suspected matches, a dataset small enough for manual inspection. Reading though, we kept only the entities where the countries of the two addresses matched. Some matches are more relevant than other since the town corresponds whereas for other we only have the country.</p>
					
					<div align="center">
					<iframe src="../img/address_matches.html"
					width="960px"
					height="525px"
					></iframe>
					</div>
					
					<p style="margin-top:2em">In this final list, we found the names of famous charities such as <i>Amnesty International</i>, <i>The Nature Conservancy</i>, <i>World Vision</i>, and <i>The American Cancer Society</i>. It is interesting to note that some charities appear two times in our list (<i>The Nature Conservancy</i> and <i>Memorial Cancer Center</i>) with different addresses. Each of these companies is therefore a suspect.</p>

					<p>We searched the web for these companies associated with their specific leak source. It seems that the common good is not the main objective of every charity. Indeed, we found that <i>The Nature Conservancy</i>, one of the biggest environmental group, was not using the donations for his environmental mission but for investing 
					in oil drilling. <br>(<a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/Paradise-Papers-Secret-Documents-Reveal-Environmental-Groups-Invest-in-Oil-Drilling-482607881.html">Environmental Groups invest in Oil Driling</a>)</br> </p>
					
					<p>Same for <i>The Duke Endowment</i> where we found that Duke university uses offshore founds to grow their endowments investing in fossil fuels. <br>(<a href=" https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/us-universities-offshore-funds-endowments-fossil-fuels-paradise-papers ">US universities use offshore funds to grow their huge endowments</a>)</br></p>
					
					<p>These results show that our first investigation method was relevant (<i>Sherlock would have been proud</i>). We did not find any signs of fraud for the other member of our list but a lot of article on the appearance of Amnesty International in the leaks. In these articles, Amnesty International denied being implicated and denounced the use of his name. 
					Despite these article or the lack of data on the implication of these charities, we choose to keep these suspects it in custody while proceeding to the second part of our analysis.</p>

					<h4>In good or bad company ? </h4>
					<p>We chose to evaluate the first-level connections of our matches in order to detect clusters. Indeed, intermediaries are crucial for an offshore service provider, handling the administration of the shell companies. If several suspected charities are all connected by a single intermediary,
					it could mean that said intermediary is specialized in charities. But if one of the connected entities is clearly a fake, there is a high probability than its neighbours are fake too. In this case, it would mean that the given intermediary is in the habit of stealing charity names for its shell companies.</p>
					<p>To get these graphs, we extracted every node corresponding to a matched entity and its associated edges. The actors at the other end of these edges were extracted as well. 
					With these data we could represent the first level connections for every entity in a form of a network and see the degree of interconnectivity between the matches. </p>
					

					
					GRAPH PANAMA
					
					<p>This graph is already very interesting to look at. About half of all the charity nodes (in yellow) are somehow connected to another charity node, which is a lot for a dataset containing over 200'000 nodes. This confirms our suspicions from above that there must be intermediaries who either specialize in charities
					, or are in the habit of using their names. A closer look shows us some familiar names, such as the World Wildlife Fund and UNICEF, connected through the Tarbes Trust.</p>
					
					GRAPH PARADISE1
					
					<p> This graph is much too large for us to handle, so we filter it down, removing any non-charity nodes that are only connected to one other node (and therefore aren't connecting anyone).</p>
					
					GRAPH PARADISE2
					
					<p>We now have a much clearer image of the connecting nodes, and we notice several things. First, UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund are back, but this time they are connected to the "Internation Red Cross",
					which the real Red Cross insists is a fake : <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/misuse-icrcs-identity-panama-papers"  target="_blank">Misuse of ICRC identity</a>.
					This is a strong argument for UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund also being stolen names (same thing for the Cancer society, which is also in this cluster).
					Notably, this cluster is not the only place where the "International Red Cross" shows up, suggesting multiple different nodes have this name, which reinforces the idea that the name is stolen. In the second, smaller cluster, we also find Amnesty International, which therefore can also be considered a victim of name theft. We can thus disclaim now Amnesty Internationnal and The Cancer Sociery that were suspected through our first analysis above. </p>
					
					GRAPH OFFSHORE 
					
					<p>This graph is also very nice. We find again the "International Red Cross" and "Amnesty International" (and also "UNICEF"!), this time connected through a different intermediary. Clearly, there is more than one company out there ripping off the names of famous charities.</p>
					
					GRAPH BAHAMAS
					
					<p>While they lack the big charity names of the previous leaks, the bahamas papers nevertheless contain some information that is particularly relevant in Switzerland. Indeed, there is a cluster of three charities, United Way, Sandy and East Meets West, where the central nodes is...Credit Suisse, 
					the second largest bank in Switzerland. A bit of research tells us that this is probably the real bank: Credit Suisse is listed as the third largest faciliator for offshore accounts in the Pana-ma Papers, and together with UBS is responsible for one in ten of all trusts leaked in the Baha-mas Papers. 
					<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/streamlining-_credit-suisse-to-close-panama-private-banking-office/42192864"  target="_blank">Credit Suisse</a>.
					Our conclusion to this research is therefore the following: always do some research before do-nating to charities, and also before opening a bank account!
