					<h2>Do you have a minute to help your neighbor?</h2>
					
					<p>In 2016, 8 out of 10 homes in Switzerland (
<a href="https://www.zewo.ch/fr/Images/Statistiken/Infografik-F-2500px.png" target="_blank">ZEWO</a>) have donated money to charities in diverse domains such as social help, education, or medical help for a total of 1,7 billions of Swiss Francs.</p>

					<p>The primary roles of a charitable organization are <i>philanthropy</i> and <i>social well-being</i>. When you donate money to a charity, you expect that your money will help those in need. The Panama Papers have shown that the reality could be darker. Indeed, some well-known caritative organization have been named in recent fraud leaks (Panamas and Paradise Papers, Offshore and Bahamas Leaks), such as the <i> International Red Cross</i> or <i>The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)</i>.</p>

					<p>This raises serious questions about how charities handle money and could create serious issues for them. Indeed, one of the main keys to success for charities is their reputation and the trust we have in them. To maintain this trust, these organizations must appear transparent and prove the truthfulness of their actions.</p>

					<p>Being caught with accounts in known tax havens can have a serious impact on the reputation of a charity and on the donations they will receive. After all, who would give money to an organisation knowing that it might well end up in some rich executive's offshore account? But the situation is much more complicated! Indeed, it has come out that many shell companies in the Panama Papers were stealing the identity of charities. This of course can put the reputations of perfectly honest charities at risk.</p>

					<p>Thus, we decided to investigate which charity named in theses leaks were worthy or not of our trust.</p>

					<p>To hunt down dishonest charities we used the database of <a href="https://www.icij.org/" target="_blank">the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a>, which contains information about major financial data leaks that occurred in the last five years. Let us tell you some more about how the most famous of these leaks: <i>the Panamas Papers</i>.</p>

					<h2>Where it all begins.</h2>
					<p><i>"Interested in data ? <…> There are a couple of conditions. My life is in danger. We will only chat over encrypted files. No meeting, ever."</i></p>

					<p>If you believe that this quote comes from a spy story, you are wrong. These are the words that started the biggest data leaks in History, leading to resignations, imprisonments and more. They come from an anonymous source, calling themselves John Doe, to Bastian Obermayer, an investigative journalist working for the Munich-based newspaper <a href="https://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56ff9a28a1bb8d3c3495ae13/" target="_blank">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a>.</p>

					<p>This resulted in more than 11.5 million leaked documents and 2.5 terabytes of data detailing the financial information of more than 214'000 offshores entities from 1970 to 2016 in more than 150 countries.</p>

					<p>In their text, titled “The revolution will be digitized”, the anonymous whistleblower explained about the leaks that he "understood enough about their contents to realise the scale of the injustices they described" and wanted to shed light upon the crimes they described.</p>

					<p>Where does the data come from? The information leaked from <i>Mossack Fonseca</i>, a Panamanian law firm and the world’s fourth larger provider of offshore financial services.</p>

					<p>After the exchange with the anonymous informer, the German newspaper sought help from the ICJC, and after a year of investigation into the leaked data, the results were finally published.</p>

					<p>Among the leaked names: one current head of state, several former heads of state and prime ministers, actors, famous football players, and… some of the world's most well-known charities.</p>

					<h2>One Dataset to rule them all.</h2>
					<p>The databases released by ICJC contain information on:</p>
					
					<ul style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:2em">
					<li><b>The Offshore Leaks</b>: 130 000 offshore accounts disclosed in a report (2013).</li>
					<li><b>The Panamas Papers</b>: 214 000 offshore accounts from <i>Monssack Fonseca</i>, as presented above (2016)</li>
					<li><b>The Bahamas Leaks</b>: 1.3 million internal files from the company register of the Bahamas (2016)</li>
					<li><b>The Paradise Papers</b>: 13.4 millions electronic documents relating to offshore investments (2017)</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>This database is powered by <i>Neo4j</i>, a graph database that structures data in nodes and relationships. The data were downloaded as several CSV files, one for each actor and one for the link between them. The different nodes represent:</p>
					
					<ul style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:2em">
					<li><b>The offshore entity</b>: a company created in a low-tax jurisdiction that often attracts non-resident client through preferential tax treatment</li>
					<li><b>The officer</b>: a person or company who play a role in an offshore entity</li>
					<li><b>The intermediary</b>: a go-between for someone seeking an offshore corporation and an offshore service provider (usually a law firm)</li>
					<li><b>The address</b>: contact postal address as it appears in the original database</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In total, this database contains information about more than 785 000 offshore entities and links to people and companies in more than 200 countries. Note these data come from leaked records and not a standardized corporate registry which could lead to duplicated entries (ICIJ did not merge records with similar names).</p>

					<p>No cleaning or standardization were necessary, except for some entity names in the Panama Papers data to split the current from the former name of the company (see ICIJ site for more details).</p>

					<p>Before investigating among the charities, we can explore the dataset and the offshore companies the have a more general view of the situation. We were particularly interested with the Panamas Papers dataset. How were distributed the offshore companies across the world? How many countries sheltered these 200 000 companies?</p>

					<p>We were not surprised to see that majority of our entities were localized in a small number of countries. Indeed more than 50% of the countries quoted in the dataset contain only a few number of offshore companies ( < 1000).</p>
					
					<img src="../img/bar.png" atl="Bar plot">
					
					<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:2em">We were surprised to find the United Kingdom in the top 5, but after investigation it appears that UK was strongly appreciated by entrepreneurs and companies for his status of UK non-domicilied that enable to avoid taxes on foreign income.</p>

					<p>In conclusion, there was no particular surprise with this top 20 since every members are well-known tax heavens leading to a non-uniform geographic distribution:</p>

					</div>

					<p style="text-align:justify;margin-top:2em"> But let's now take a closer look on our charities! How can we distinguish between real charities and shell companies? We needed first to find these charities in the database. Since no detail was given in the set about the possible function of the different companies we needed external data.</p>
					
					<p>We chose to use the Forbes Top 100 of charities, the list of main non-governmental organizations and the list of main charities on Wikipedia. We scraped these data in order to form a new database on well-known charities. By merging together these results we obtained detailed information on more than 300 charities that we could use to investigate the ICIJ database. Among these information we found the name of the charities, the name of principal leaders, the headquarters address and the location of principal offices. Note that the available data varies from charity to charity, resulting in a sometime sparse dataset.</p>

					<p>We decided to isolate potential charities by their name with comparison with our newly construct dataset by text mining. We took as charities the offshore companies that have a right amount of significative word in common with the charities name in our dataset. With this method we isolate a hundreds of matches.</p>

					<p>Considering the few number of matches and since human possess an expertise in natural language processing superior to any training tool, we inspected and corrected manually the potential matches.</p>

					<p>Among them, we found Amnesty Internationnal, the Red Cross and other world’s biggest aid agency. But as said sooner some shell companies were named after charities with which they had no connection. The law firm used these humanitarian organization as a cover when facing down demands for information from prying banks and financial institutions.</p>
