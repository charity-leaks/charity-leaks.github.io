					<h2>Do you have a minute to help your neighbor?</h2>
					
					<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.zewo.ch/fr/Images/Statistiken/Infografik-F-2500px.png" target="_blank">8 out of 10 homes in Switzerland donated money to charities</a> in diverse domains such as social help, education, or medical aid, for a total of 1.7 billion Swiss Francs.</p>

					<p>The primary roles of a charitable organization are <i>philanthropy</i> and <i>social well-being</i>. When you donate money to a charity, you expect that your money will help those in need. The Panama Papers have shown that the reality could be darker. Indeed, some well-known caritative organizations, such as the <i> International Red Cross</i> or <i>The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)</i>, have been named in recent leaks (Panamas and Paradise Papers, Offshore and Bahamas Leaks).</p>

					<p>This raises many questions about how charities handle money and could create serious issues for them. After all, one of the keys to success for charities is their reputation and the trust we have in them. To maintain this trust, these organizations must appear transparent and demonstrate honesty in their actions.</p>

					<p>Being caught with accounts in known tax havens can have a serious impact on the reputation of a charity and on the donations they will receive. After all, who would give money to an organisation knowing that it might well end up in some rich executive's offshore account? But the situation is much more complicated! Indeed, it has come out that many shell companies in the Panama Papers were stealing the identity of charities. This of course can put the reputations of perfectly honest charities at risk.</p>

					<p>Thus, we decided to investigate which charities could be found in the leaked documents, whether they could be positively identified as real or usurped, and how they relate to each other in this tangled web.</p>

					<p>To hunt down these charities, we used the database of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/" target="_blank">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> (from here on ICIJ), which contains information about major financial data leaks that occurred in the last five years. Let us tell you some more about the most famous of these leaks: <i>The Panamas Papers</i>.</p>
